## How the TSC operates
The TSC meets every other Wednesday at 16 UTC on [Uberconference](https://www.uberconference.com/opendatakit). Meetings are open for non-TSC members to listen. Meeting announcements, recordings and notes are shared [on the forum](https://forum.opendatakit.org/tags/tsc). Meetings are led by a rotating facilitator. The facilitator is responsible for generating an agenda. Anyone can propose agenda items by commenting on the meeting announcement post.

The agenda includes time caps for each item. A time keeper is selected at the beginning of each meeting and is responsible for stopping discussion when time is up.

The TSC uses [consensus-seeking decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making). When an agenda item has appeared to reach concensus, the facilitator asks for any dissent. If there is dissent, a vote on the issue can be called by any member.

As much as possible, the TSC operates in public.

Private matters regarding individuals such as committer nominations are discussed in [the private TSC forum category](https://forum.opendatakit.org/c/governance/tsc).

## Adding new committers
The [TSC governance](https://github.com/opendatakit/governance/blob/master/TECHNICAL-STEERING-COMMITTEE.md) requires that the TSC choose a process for adding new committers. Because discussions about specific community members are sensitive, nominations and voting occurs in [the private TSC forum category](https://forum.opendatakit.org/c/governance/tsc). Selection of a new committer requires consensus approval as described in the [PMC governance](https://github.com/opendatakit/governance/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#types-of-approval): three binding +1 votes and no binding -1 votes are required over a 72 hour period. Further, the three binding votes must be from different organizations.

## Roadmapping
Most project decisions are made through [lazy consensus](https://github.com/opendatakit/governance/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#lazy-consensus). The TSC is responsible for maintaining a roadmap to ensure a coherent evolution of the core tools and to guide contributions from community members. The TSC is also the final authority for specifying larger or more controversial features.

The roadmap is maintained in [the Roadmap GitHub project](https://github.com/opendatakit/roadmap/projects/1).

The typical process is:
- Any community member describes a feature [in the forum Features category](https://forum.opendatakit.org/c/features) and high-level discussion occurs
- A TSC member takes all the feedback from the forum and writes a specification in a [Roadmap repository](https://github.com/opendatakit/roadmap) issue
- The TSC discusses and refines specifications during its meetings
- Accepted specifications are placed on the [roadmap](https://github.com/opendatakit/roadmap/projects/1)

## Meeting Facilitator Checklist
1. Ensure a thread for the meeting is present on the forum. [Here is an example](https://forum.opendatakit.org/t/odk-1-tsc-call-2018-02-21/11700).
2. Construct agenda
    1. Open [agenda document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KdUeiryViiPyiG8ajDC_snxSzDBBb-kwNauHvD_chfA/edit)

    3. Copy the agenda template (at very bottom of document) to that page.
    4. Copy action items from the previous meeting into the new agenda for follow up.

    6. Look in the [parking lot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-kWC17JrlSmOb8qXBMTFhN6q-NbDEDyQnko7r4Zor-I/edit#gid=0) for potential agenda items.
    7. Also check for any agenda item requests in the above forum thread. If something from the thread doesn’t make it into the meeting, put it in the [parking lot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-kWC17JrlSmOb8qXBMTFhN6q-NbDEDyQnko7r4Zor-I/edit#gid=0).
